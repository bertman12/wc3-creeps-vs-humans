players cannot have more than 50 units in their spawn pool

players can capture gold mines which will give gold to the owner.
killing units gives you wood
hero kills give gold and wood

players can set traps for enemy heroes which when spring (via land mine trickery) will summon a unit to attack the hero

gold mines give gold every 10 seconds ; 100gold

if you have no gold mines, then you are eliminated or subjugated by the killing player of your last mine

Make it so creeps will find a new random valid target every 90 seconds if it hasnt changed, to prevent rushing player bases
