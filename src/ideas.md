**\*** w3e file will contain the map terrain data

players cannot have more than 50 units in their spawn pool

players can capture gold mines which will give gold to the owner.
killing units gives you wood
hero kills give gold and wood

players can set traps for enemy heroes which when spring (via land mine trickery) will summon a unit to attack the hero

gold mines give gold every 10 seconds ; 100gold

if you have no gold mines, then you are eliminated or subjugated by the killing player of your last mine

Make it so creeps will find a new random valid target every 90 seconds if it hasnt changed, to prevent rushing player bases

add fortified mines upgrade which gives mines multishot

give 2nd attack to base that only targets heros and deos alot of chaos dmg

maybe also let players choose their inital units spawned

add some units tehy can spawn that last 30 seconds to help push ut from base

add creep hero choice

800g for weapon and armor upgrades

1500g to add new units to your unit pool

Make info abilities for players

murloc camp, troll camp, gnoll camp options to start off
the base melee unit from each camp should be the same stats for each

add upgrades to gold mine health and also add upgrades to gold mine attack

add upgrade to amount of creeps spawned every spawn interval
so each spawn will just check the player state object and check what upgrades they have and then will update

so when an upgrade finishes we will upgrade the spawn for the player, also make the spawns stronger and able to fend off hero cheese
add a stun ability on your base that will let you stun heroes to help prevent cheese

make +10 armor and weapons the max upgrades you can get
